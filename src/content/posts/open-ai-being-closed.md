**By Sigal Samuel | September 27, 2024**

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has abandoned its founding principles.

For years, OpenAI was celebrated as a nonprofit aiming to develop AI safely and for the benefit of humanity. But this week, the company shifted course, transforming into a for-profit benefit corporation, and handing CEO Sam Altman an equity stake worth billions. This move undermines the core mission the company was founded on and reveals a stark profit-driven direction.

### The Nonprofit Dream Is Over

Since its inception in 2015, OpenAI prided itself on a nonprofit status, touting a board designed to keep AI development safe. It pledged not to focus on financial returns but rather on humanity's welfare. That vision is now officially dead.

When Altman took the reins in 2019, the company began its shift by creating a for-profit arm to attract major investments—most notably from Microsoft. Despite this, OpenAI maintained a capped-profit model, ensuring that beyond a 100x return on investments, profits would flow back to the nonprofit.

This week’s restructuring throws that model out the window. OpenAI will now fully prioritize profit, with Altman holding both financial stakes and ultimate control. In an unsurprising yet ominous move, Mira Murati, the company’s CTO, abruptly resigned before the news broke, leaving employees blindsided.

### How We Got Here

OpenAI began with grand aspirations: to be free from financial obligations, with its research benefiting all of humanity. In its early years, OpenAI promoted itself as the alternative to typical tech companies that were driven by profit. But the writing was on the wall as the company gradually shifted toward commercialization.

By 2023, Altman’s leadership faced internal distrust, with the nonprofit board attempting to oust him. Altman retaliated by leveraging his ties to Microsoft, restructuring the board to ensure his control. This week’s events mark the culmination of that power grab: Altman has effectively removed the board’s power, ensuring that the company’s primary focus is now financial gain.

### Why Does This Matter?

Many experts, including former employees like Jeffrey Wu, see this shift as the final nail in the coffin for OpenAI’s founding mission. The transformation aligns OpenAI with the tech industry’s race for profit and deviates from its initial focus on transparency and safety.

As OpenAI turns its focus to attracting more investment, the concern is that safety will take a backseat. AI development comes with significant risks, and the stakes are especially high with increasingly advanced models that could reshape industries—and societies. Without oversight, OpenAI’s new profit-driven motives could endanger public safety and ethics.

### The Need for Regulation

This moment serves as a wake-up call. If OpenAI is willing to abandon its founding values for profit, it underscores the urgent need for regulatory frameworks to govern AI companies. AI safety advocates have long warned that tech giants like OpenAI could become too powerful without adequate oversight.

Sam Altman’s consolidation of power within OpenAI should prompt governments and regulators to take action. California’s SB 1047, a bill designed to provide oversight of big AI companies, is one such piece of legislation in play. If this move by OpenAI demonstrates anything, it's that AI companies cannot be trusted to regulate themselves.

The public must demand accountability to ensure that the companies developing these powerful tools remain committed to public safety over profits.
